In this repo, we are trying to explore how to digest data format that yt package do not support and find a way to make the "data load" process much easier

Specifically, we have done the following tasks with three cases

* manually load datasets into yt and visualize them with yt function directly (done)
* automatically load the datasets with specified schema (done)
* embed rete.js into jupyter and explore whether we can create a tool to facilitate the whole process of data loading (in progress)
